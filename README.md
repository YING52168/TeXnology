This repo contains my `TEXMFHOME` folder, some [`arara`][arara] stuff, and [`lingsem`][lingsem], which is a set of LaTeX macros for typesetting semantics that I have been developing. Feel free to contribute to `lingsem` with code and/or "plain text" comments/suggestions/improvements via the [issue tracker][issues]!
